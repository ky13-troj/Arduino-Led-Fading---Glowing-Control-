# Arduino-Led-Fading---Glowing-Control-
This is my Sem-4 Physics Hons Arduino project.
In this project I use the serialmonitor in arduino cc software to select which LED will glow or fade . And Output corresponding to each user nput is shown in serial monitor and also in a 
LCD Display which is connected to the Breadboard.
How everything works is mentioned in the pdf file.
